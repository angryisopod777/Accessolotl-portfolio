			But, behold! They offer to make us a deal. They explain that they will refrain from destroying our planet if we provide them
			sufficient resources to understand how our most coveted resource, Boba tea, can be ordered without any human interaction.
			Naturally, we take them up on this offer, promising to provide as many ways as possible for them to step into our shoes and understand
			the glories, and hardships, of our contactless boba ordering interface.

                  An accessibility analysis of the boba ordering station was conducted in order to determine how usable it was to beings with

                      There are no options to increase the font size of the text elements, making the ordering station

                      The ordering station is placed around eye level for a 5 foot tall person and the height is not adjustable, making it

                  After successfully interviewing boba-loving humans, creating personas from their observations, developing a storyboard of an interaction with the contactless boba ordering station, and conducting
                  an accessibility analysis, the Accessolotls better understand
			how humans interact with the interface and decide they will not destroy Earth! Hooray!
