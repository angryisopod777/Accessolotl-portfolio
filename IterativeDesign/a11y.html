                  Since Accessolotls want to take over the world using accessibility,
                  they naturally want to enable developers to make their websites accessible!
                  What's a better way to motivate people to do something than cute virtual pets? So the 
                  Accessolotls set out to create a helpful a11y buddy to help developers fix accessibility errors
                  while they create their websites.

                    <li>There is only a hover icon available to use to read instructions on how to use the extension, so in the future there will be a fully accessible instructions screen that does not require hovering a mouse.</li>
                    <li>
                      There are only very brief descriptions of how to fix the encountered errors in the given warnings, so these will be expanded in the future to enable people who are completely new to the world of accessibility to benefit from this tool.

                  After successfully creating a working prototype of a virtual pet to aid in accessible website development, the Accessolotls learned that there are still many more ways the extension itself can be more accessible, and they are excited to continue working on this project and get it published to the extension market place.
